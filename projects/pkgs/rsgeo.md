# rsgeo

`rsgeo` is an interface to the Rust libraries `geo-types` and `geo`.
`geo-types` implements pure rust geometry primitives. The `geo` library
adds additional algorithm functionalities on top of `geo-types`. This
package lets you harness the speed, safety, and memory efficiency of
these libraries. `geo-types` does not support Z or M dimensions. There
is no support for CRS at this moment.
