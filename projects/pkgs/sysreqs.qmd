The goal of sysreqs is to make it easy to identify R package system dependencies. There are two components to this package: an "API" and a wrapper package.

This API and package is based on rstudio/r-system-requirements and the API client for RStudio Package Manager. The functionality is inspired by pak::pkg_system_requirements().
