title: "mirrr - song genre classification"

Tidy Music Information Retrieval was a bookdown project I wrote back in 2019 that created a stacked ensemble model that predicted musical genre from song audio features and song lyrics.

I created 3 models. The first utilized LDA text classification outputs from song lyrics as inputs into a classification model. The second used song audio features from spotify. The third model used the outputs of both to create a stacked ensemble model.
