The [Urban Informatics Toolkit (uitk)](https://ui.josiahparry.com/) is an open text book I wrote with the intention of teaching first year graduate students in Urban Informatics the R programming language.

Within it are two years of study in the Urban Informatics Program at Northeastern University, five years of self-directed education in R, two years of teaching R, and innumerable hours learning R.
