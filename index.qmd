I make R go fast 🏎️💨
:::

My name is Josiah (pronounced Joe-sigh-uh) and I believe **R belongs in production**. 

I have a penchant for writing R packages that are really fast and efficient. Typically, this involves writing Rust and glueing R them together using [`extendr`](https://extendr.github.io/extendr/extendr_api/).

I also, quite specifically, like solving geospatial problems. I work at [Esri](https://esri.com) doing spatial statistics and—you guessed it—writing R packages. 

Do you and your organization need help?
