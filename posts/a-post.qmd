more stuff 

This really feels a lot more like the general programming exerpeicen I've gotten in every language that isn't R.

The documentation is thin. The Google brain hasn't yet propagated the best blog posts to the top, yet. 

The github discussions use the words "just" and "simply" quite a bit as if it's easy and simple. Like you should have _just_ known to do that. It's so obvious, clearly!
