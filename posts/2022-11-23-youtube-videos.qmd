### TLDR 

Please vote or post a comment in [this discuss](https://github.com/JosiahParry/quarto-site/discussions/4) on what would be helpful for you.

---------


I first made R programming videos when I had the opportunity to teach a remote and asynchronous course called [Big Data for Cities](https://bd4c.netlify.app/). I used the videos as alternative learning material besides a [text-book](https://ui.josiahparry.com/) and other required readings. 

I just recently noticed that my video [Making your R Markdown Pretty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v048ru5v0BE&t=1s&ab_channel=JosiahParry) has 16 thousand views. I never thought it would reach that many people! So, if I've helped even 0.1% of those people it will have been worth it. 

I've started to record some more videos on spatial analaysis in R. I think the spatial anlaysis / statistics videos on youtube are lacking in diversityâ€”with the noteable exception of [@GeostatsGuyLectures](https://www.youtube.com/@GeostatsGuyLectures) but he's more of a environmental scientist :) I will note, though, that the lectures of Luc Anselin are one of the only reason why I am where I am in my knowledge and abilities.

The thing about Anselin's videos, though, is that they are not about the _how_ of doing it. But they focus more on the theory and the math that sits behind the statistics themselves. 


## I ask you! 

What do you want to see? What is actually helpful? I'm sure me stumbling and mumbling for 18 minutes on spatial lags can't be too helpful.
