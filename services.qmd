Whether you need help with R package development, 
Shiny app or plumber API deployment, or making your analytics scale better, I'm here to lend a hand.

I've got a small block of time each week that I 
can dedicate to consulting. It's not a lot, but 
it's enough to make a big impact on your project. 

- Writing performant R packages for data analysis
- Planning deployments of Shiny apps and Plumber 
APIs
- Scaling analytics code for large datasets and 
complex calculations
- Developing bespoke training programs tailored to 
your team's needs
- Training developers on Rust and extending R 
packages with Rust
